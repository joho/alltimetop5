# alltimetop5

My very first rails app shall ride again as a react/fluxible/rails-api monstrosity.

## Dev

Needs ruby 2.3.0 with bundler & foreman for the backend, and node v5.3.0.

`foreman start` will do ruby & webpack in dev.

`cd assets && npm test` will run js tests.

## Production

Running on heroku. https://alltimetop5.herokuapp.com/

Deploy via `./deploy.sh`
